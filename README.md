# üîç Lead Scoring Workflow (n8n + MCP)

This project implements a dynamic lead scoring system using the **n8n automation platform** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to integrate real-time data from HubSpot, BigPicture API, and Adzuna. A lightweight frontend built using HTML is hosted on GitHub Pages for live testing.

## üß† Project Architecture

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Trigger Input**
   - Starts from an email submitted via the GitHub Pages form.
   - This triggers a webhook in n8n.

2. **Contact Details (HubSpot via MCP)**
   - Retrieves contact details (name, title, company, last activity, stage) using MCP from HubSpot.
   - Example node: `Get Contact Details (MCP Pipedream‚ÜíHubSpot)`

3. **Company Metadata (BigPicture API)**
   - Uses the company name to fetch its domain.
   - Then fetches company metadata: size, industry, type.

4. **Open Roles (Adzuna API)**
   - Queries Adzuna using the domain to get current job openings count.

5. **Score Calculation (JavaScript)**
   - Score is computed based on:
     - +3 if title includes "VP" or "Director"
     - +2 if company size > 100
     - +1 if contact date is within 7 days
     - -1 if lifecycle stage is still "Lead"

6. **Final Output**
   - The result is merged and returned as a JSON response via `Respond to Webhook`.
   - The frontend UI displays the score, contact details, and explanation.
